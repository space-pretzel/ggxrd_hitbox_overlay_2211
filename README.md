![Screenshot can't be viewed](screen.jpg)

## Description

Adds hitboxes overlaid on top of characters/projectiles for Guilty Gear Xrd Rev2 version 2211 (as of 12'th February 2025).  
Adds framebar and framedata display (see [Framebar](#framebar) section).
Also can freeze the game and play it frame-by-frame (with box display turned off for example) (see main mod's UI window - Hitboxes section within the mod).  
Also can screenshot the game with transparency enabled/disabled (made with help from WorseThanYou (visit his website! <https://worsety.github.io/>)).  
Also contains position reset mod (see [Position Reset Mod](#position-reset-mod) section).  
Also contains input history mod (see [Input History Mod](#input-history-mod) section) which can display input history when observing online matches, and it can display durations of each input in the input history.  
Also it can hide the main Enter key or numpad Enter key presses from the game, or both (in General Settings).  
Also it can hide wins on the rematch screen (see [Hide Wins Mod](#hide-wins-mod) section).
Also it can hide rank icons (circle, arrow up/down, equal sign) next to players (enable in General Settings).  
Also it can display a "PUNISH" message when landing a hit on an opponent either after blocking their hit or when they're in a recovery portion of a move.  
Also it can change the FPS in Training Mode.  
The mod can optionally hide its output from OBS recording (can be turned on in 'UI - Settings - General Settings - Dodge OBS Recording').  
Includes Hitbox Editor that can save/load edited hitboxes to/from .collision and .json files.  
Can speed up replay playback.  
Has Quick Character Select popup for 'Player Match' online mode (no default hotkey, need to assign one in 'Settings - Keyboard Shortcuts').

Many thanks to WorseThanYou (@worsety), without whose help this wouldn't have been possible.  
Thanks to @PCvolt for advice on framebar and allowing to add his labtool's (<https://github.com/PCvolt/rev2-Labtool>) functionality to this mod. Thanks to WorseThanYou (again) for help and advice on framebar.  
Thanks to Pangaea for their BBScript database (<https://github.com/super-continent/bbscript>), which is invaluable in understanding almost everything about how the game works. The people who made the database seem to have reverse engineered the entire game, it's really amazing!

## System requirements

Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2022 (x86 for the 32-bit version, x64 for the 64-bit version).  
Intel processor architecture x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) (AMD will work). Windows operating system.  
For Ubuntu/Linux you need to be running the Windows version of Guilty Gear Xrd (I'm not aware of a Linux version existing) under Steam Proton.

## Quickstart for Windows

1. Make sure you have Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2022 installed on your operating system. Pick the right version for your architecture:
  - 32-bit: <https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe> (alternatively, use INSTALL_VCRUNTIME140.DLL_32bit .url shortcut included with the mod)
  - 64-bit: <https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe> (alternatively, use INSTALL_VCRUNTIME140.DLL_64bit .url shortcut included with the mod)

2. Download the latest release from the `Releases` section on the right side of this page.

3. Launch the game. Or you can do the next step at any point while the game is running.

4. Go to downloaded folder and launch `ggxrd_hitbox_injector.exe`.

5. Start training mode. Hitboxes should display (they won't display in online matches by default).

Read the [Hitboxes](#hitboxes) section to understand what the colors mean.  
Read the [Default Hotkeys](#default-hotkeys) section to know what the default hotkeys are.  
You can also play the game frame-by-frame (use main mod UI window - 'Hitboxes' section for that, no default hotkeys, but they can be set up in 'Settings - Keyboard Shortcuts').

To turn off the mod you can launch `ggxrd_hitbox_injector.exe` again.

The mod may show up as a virus. I swear this is not a virus, check the source code, compile this yourself if still doubting. Check commit history of this repo. Add this to whatever antivirus exceptions necessary and run as administrator if necessary.

## Quickstart for Ubuntu/Linux

On Ubuntu/Linux the injector won't work on its own. You need to cd into the mod's directory and type into the console:

```bash
chmod u+x launch_ggxrd_hitbox_injector_linux.sh
./launch_ggxrd_hitbox_injector_linux.sh
```

This will launch the injector (the .exe one) on the same Wine server that Guilty Gear runs on. Assuming you're running the game using Steam Proton, and its version is supported, everything should work.  
If it doesn't work, you can use the following methods:

## Making the game always launch with the mod

There are two ways to make the game always start with the mod:

### Method 1)

Find the BootGGXrd.bat file in the game's directory. Edit it using Notepad and add the following line to the end:

```bash
start /MIN ggxrd_hitbox_injector -force
```

The `start /MIN` is needed to prevent the injector window from stealing focus from Xrd if Xrd launches directly into fullscreen.

Save the file. Then, copy the `ggxrd_hitbox_injector.exe` and the `ggxrd_hitbox_overlay.dll` to the game's `Binaries\Win32` folder.

### Method 2)

If you patch the game, it will always load the DLL automatically on startup. The `ggxrd_hitbox_patcher_linux` and `ggxrd_hitbox_patcher` do exactly that (on Linux and Windows respectively) and must be launched directly, without Wine. (If on Linux the patcher doesn't start, you might need to do `chmod u+x ggxrd_hitbox_patcher_linux`.) The patcher on Ubuntu/Linux, when it asks, must be provided the full path to the game executable (`GuiltyGearXrd.exe`) without quotes. The Windows patcher will show a file selection dialog instead.  

### Notes for Method 1) and 2)

The patched game will now try to load the `ggxrd_hitbox_overlay.dll` on startup. In order for the game to find the DLL it must be placed in the same directory as the game executable, which, on Linux, should be in Steam's directory, for example: `~/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/GUILTY GEAR Xrd -REVELATOR-/Binaries/Win32`, where `~` is your home directory.  
If the DLL is not found when the game launches, it will just run normally, without the mod.  
Normally you can run the injector to unload the mod, but if for whatever reason you can't run it on Linux, then there's no way to unload the mod. To solve this you can add the `.ini` file mentioned in [Hotkey configuration](#hotkey-configuration) section into the folder with the game executable and change the line `startDisabled = false` to `startDisabled = true` in it and use the `F6` (the default) hotkey to enable the mod when you need.

If Steam Proton is taking forever to launch the game, patched or not, then rename the mod's dll and put the original, unpatched version of the game executable back, then try switching the Proton version in Steam's settings and agree to restart Steam. After restarting Steam will start downloading two things related to Guilty Gear Xrd and will launch GGXrd automatically (even though you didn't tell it to). GGXrd should work. Quit GGXrd. Place the patched version of the game executable and the mod's dll back and restart GGXrd. GGXrd will launch with the mod. Idk what causes this.

## Hitboxes

### Red - Hitboxes

Strike and projectile non-throw hitboxes are shown in red. Clash-only hitboxes are shown in more transparent red with thinner outline. Hitboxes' fills may never be absent.

### Green - Hurtboxes

Normally hurtboxes display in green. The rules in general are such, that when a hitbox (red) makes contact with hurtbox, a hit occurs.  
If a hurtbox is displayed fully transparent (i.e. shows outline only), that means strike invulnerability.  
If a hurtbox is hatched with diagonal lines, that means some form of super armor is active: it could be parry (Jam 46P), projectile reflection (Zato Drunkard Shade), super armor (Potemkin Hammerfall), or projectile-only invulnerability (Ky Ride the Lightning), or direct player attacks-only invulnerability (Ky j.D). This visual hatching effect can be combined with the hurtbox being not filled in, meaning strike invulerability + super armor/other.  
For Jack O's and Bedman's summons the hurtbox's outline may be thin to create less clutter on the screen.

### Light blue - Would-be counterhit hurtboxes

If your hurtbox is displaying light blue, that means, should you get hit, you would enter counterhit state. It means that moves that have light blue hurtbox on recovery are more punishable.  
If a hurtbox is hatched with diagonal lines, that means some form of super armor is active: it could be parry (Jam 46P), projectile reflection (Zato Drunkard Shade), super armor (Potemkin Hammerfall), or projectile-only invulnerability (Ky Ride the Lightning), or direct player attacks-only invulnerability (Ky j.D).

### Gray - Pre-hit hurtboxes

When you get hit a gray outline appears on top of your current hurtbox. This outline represents the previous state of your hurtbox, before you got hit. Its purpose is to make it easier to see how or why you got hit.

### Yellow - Pushboxes

Each player has a pushbox. When two pushboxes collide, the players get pushed apart until their pushboxes no longer collide. Pushbox widths also affect throw range - more on that in next section(s).  
If a pushbox is displayed fully transparent (i.e. shows outline only), that means throw invulnerability.  
Pushbox outline is always thin.

### Point/Cross - Origin points

Each player has an origin point which is shown as a black-white cross on the ground between their feet. When players jump, the origin point tracks their location. Origin points play a key role in throw hit detection.

### Small black & white dot - Projectile origin points

Projectiles whose origin points were deemed to be important enough to be shown will display them as black and white tiny square points. They visualize the projectiles' position which may be used in some range or interaction checks.  

Player center of body or other point. These points may be important in some kind of interactions, but they're not the origin point, and to distinguish that they're drawn using the style of projectile origin points so that they look smaller and less important.

### Blue - Rejection boxes

When a Blitz Shield meets a projectile it displays a square blue box around the rejecting player, and if the opponent's origin point is within that box the opponent enters rejected state. The box does not show when rejecting normal, melee attacks because those cause rejection no matter the distance. Pushboxes and their sizes do not affect the distance check in any way, i.e. only the X and Y distances between the players' origin points are checked.

### Blue - Throw box pushbox check (when drawPushboxCheckSeparately = true - the default)

When a player does a throw he displays a throw box which may either be represented as one blue box, one purple box or one blue and one purple box. Throw boxes are usually only active for one frame (that's when they display semi-transparent). This period is so brief throw boxes have to show for a few extra frames, but during those frames they're no longer active and so they display fully transparent (outline only).

The blue part of the box shows the pushbox-checking throw box. It is never limited vertically, because it only checks the horizontal distance between pushboxes. The rule is if this blue throw box touches the yellow pushbox of the opponent, the pushbox-checking part of the throw is satisfied.  
But there may be another part of the throw that checks the X and/or Y of the opponent's origin point (shown in purple). If such a part of the throw box is present, it must also be satisfied, or else the throw won't connect.

This mode of showing throw boxes shows them like this:

![Screenshot can't be viewed](throw_box_drawPushboxCheckSeparately_true.jpg)

### Purple - Throw box origin point check (when drawPushboxCheckSeparately = true - the default)

The purple part of the throw box displays the region where the opponent's origin point must be in order for this part of the throw check to connect.  
If there's a pushbox-proximity-checking part of the throw (blue), then satisfying the origin point check (purple) is not enough - the pushbox check must be passed as well. The pushbox-checking part of the throw displays in blue and is described in the section above.

### Blue - Throw boxes (when drawPushboxCheckSeparately = false)

There's an alternative mode in the mod to show the part of the throw box that checks pushbox proximity (blue) and the part of the throw box that checks the X and Y of the opponent's origin point (purple) as a single blue throw box which only checks the opponent's origin point. To turn this mode on place the `.ini` file described in [Hotkey configuration](#hotkey-configuration) into the folder with the game executable and change `drawPushboxCheckSeparately = true` to be `drawPushboxCheckSeparately = false`. (Reloading the mod is unnecessary.)

In this mode, when a player does a throw he displays a throw box in blue color. Throw boxes are usually only active for one frame (that's when they display semi-transparent). This period is so brief throw boxes have to show for a few extra frames, but during those frames they're no longer active and so they display fully transparent (outline only).

In this mode, throw boxes must only include the opponent's origin point in order to connect (but that's not all, read on). That means that the sizes of your and your opponent's pushboxes affect the width of your throw box. Try crouching and see how your pushbox becomes wider a bit. This means crouching opponents are slightly easier to throw. Or Potemkin - he has a wider pushbox than average.

It's in the rules of the game that ground throws may only connect with non-airborne opponents and air throws may only connect with airborne opponents. Opponents who are in prejump state cannot be ground thrown.  
Most normal ground throws and ground command throws for this reason do not limit their throw boxes vertically: the throw box shows as a pillar reaching vertically over the entire screen's height. This doesn't mean they capture anything above or below the thrower, though, and the rules mentioned above are still being obeyed.

Some throws check for vertical position of the opponent's origin point and so display their throw box limited in size vertically.  
When visually checking to see if a throw box would connect with an opponent you should, in this mod, ignore the pushboxes altogether and focus only on the throw box catching the origin point.  
Note that normal ground throw actually simply checks if distance between the pushboxes is below the attacker's throw range (values listed on Dustloop), however some throws like command throws or air throws also check if the origin point specifically is within x or y range. Hence this is why this mode exists to just always show the check on the origin point only.

This mode of showing throw boxes shows them like this:

### White - Interaction boxes/circles

Boxes or circles like this are displayed when a move is checking ranges. They may be checking distance to a player's origin point or to their 'center', depending on the type of move or projectile. All types of displayed interactions will be listed here down below.

- Ky Stun Edge, Charged Stun Edge and Sacred Edge: The box shows the area in which Ciel's origin point must be in order for the projectile to become Fortified.

- May Beach Ball: The circle shows the range in which May's center of body must be in order to jump on the ball. May's center of body is additionally displayed as a smaller point, instead of like a cross, like her origin point. Now, this may be a bit much, but a white line is also displayed connecting May's center of body point to the ball's point that is at the center of the circle. This line serves no purpose other than to remind the user that the range check of the circle is done against the center of body point of May, not her origin point. The display of all this needs to be enabled with dontShowMayInteractionChecks setting ('Settings - Hitboxes - Don't Show May Interaction Checks' in mod's UI).

- May Dolphin: The circle shows the range in which May's behind the body point must be in order to ride the Dolphin. The point behind May's body depends on May's facing, and not the Dolphin's. Additionally, a line connecting May's behind the body point and the origin point of the Dolphin is shown. It serves no purpose other than to remind the user that the distance check is performed against May's behind the body point, and not her origin point. The display of all this needs to be enabled with dontShowMayInteractionChecks setting ('Settings - Hitboxes - Don't Show May Interaction Checks' in mod's UI).

- Millia Pin: The infinite vertical box shows the range in which Millia's origin point must be in order for the Pin to be picked up. Millia must be in either of the following animations:
  - Stand to Crouch
  - Crouch
  - Crouch Turn (as of Rev2)
  - Roll (as of Rev2)
  - Doubleroll (as of Rev2)
  
- Millia Bad Moon Buff Height: The infinite horizontal line shows the height above which Millia's origin point must be in order for Bad Moon to get some attack powerup. However, Bad Moon is limited by the maximum number of hits it can deal, which increases with height (the buff height is 500000, next buffs are at 650000, 800000, 950000, 1100000, 1250000, 1400000). The display of the height line must be enabled with showMilliaBadMoonBuffHeight setting ('UI - Character specific - Show Millia Bad Moon Buff Height (Rev2 only)').
  
- Faust Food Items: The white box shows where a player's origin point must be in order to pick up the food item.
  
- Faust Helium: The circle shows the range in which opponent's or Faust's origin point must be in order to pick up the Helium.
  
- Faust 5D: The inner circle shows the range in which the thrown item's origin point must be in order to achieve a homerun hit. The outer circles shows the range in which the thrown item's origin point must be in order to achieve a non-homerun hit. This display needs to be enabled with showFaustOwnFlickRanges setting ('UI - Character specific - Show Faust Own Projectile Flick Ranges'). The circle is displayed for more than one frame, but it is filled in on only one. The frame when it is filled in is when it is active, and the other frames are just for visual clarity, so you could have enough time to actually see the circle.

- Bedman Task C Height Buff: The infinite horizontal line shows the height above which Bedman's origin point must be in order for Task C to gain a powerup that makes it slam the ground harder. That height is 700000. The display of the height line must be enabled with showBedmanTaskCHeightBuffY INI setting (located in UI in Character Specific - Show Bedman Height Buff Y).

- Ramlethal Sword Re-Deploy No-Teleport Distance: The infinite vertical boxes around the swords show the distance in which the opponent's origin point must be in order for the sword to not spend extra time teleporting to the opponent when you re-deploy it.

- Sin Hawk Baker Red Hit Box: The line connecting Sin to the wall that he's facing has a marking on it denoting the maximum distance he must be from the wall, as one of two possible ways to get a red hit. The distance marker checks for Sin's origin point, not his pushbox. If Sin is too far from the wall that he is facing, the other way to get a red hit is for the opponent's origin point to be close to Sin, inside the infinite white vertical box drawn around him. If Sin is neither close to the wall he's facing nor close enough to the opponent, the hit is blue.

- Elphelt Max Charge Shotgun: If the opponent's origin point is within the infinite white vertical box around Elphelt, then the shotgun shot gets the maximum possible powerup.

- Johnny Bacchus Sigh: If the opponent's center of body (marked with an extra small point) is within the circle, Bacchus Sigh will connect on the next frame.

- Jack-O' Ghost Pickup Range: The displayed vertical box around each Ghost (house) shows the range in which Jack-O's origin point must be in order to pick up the Ghost or gain Tension from it. This is only displayed when the 'showJackoGhostPickupRange' setting in the INI is on (in UI it's located at main mod's UI - Character Specific - Show Jack-O' Ghost Pickup Range).

- Jack-O' Aegis Field Range: The white circle shows the range where the Ghosts' or Servants' origin points must be in order for them to receive protection of the Field. This display must be enabled with the 'showJackoAegisFieldRange' setting in the INI file (located in mod's UI - Character Specific - Show Jack-O' Aegis Field Range).

- Jack-O' Servant Attack Range: The white box around each Servant shows the area where the opponent's player's origin point must be in order for the Servant to initiate an attack. This display must be enabled with the 'showJackoServantAttackRange' setting in the INI file (located in mod's UI - Character Specific - Show Jack-O' Servant Attack Range).

- Jam Bao Saishinshou: The white box shows the vertical range where the opponent's origin point be upon the hit connecting in order to be vacuumed by the attack.

- Haehyun Enlightened 3000 Palm Strike: The giant circle shows where the opponent's center of body point has to be in order to be vacuumed. The center of body points of both players are shown and a line connecting them is shown as a guide for what exact distance is being measured by the game.

- Baiken Metsudo Kushodo: The white box shows the area where opponent's origin point must be at the moment the move is performed, in order for Baiken to shoot out ropes and travel to the opposite wall.

- Answer Scroll: The white box around the scroll shows the area where Answer's origin point must be in order to cling to the scroll. After entering the area, you are able to cling only on the frame after the next one. So Enter range -> Wait -> Cling.

- Answer Card: The infinite vertical white box around the card shows the area where the opponent's origin point must be in order for the Clone to track to their position.

- Leo bt.D successful parry: The white box around Leo shows where the origin point of the opponent must be in order to get vaccuumed.

- Baiken Tsurane Sanzu-watashi: The white box in front of Baiken shows where the origin point of the opponent must be at the moment of the second hit in order to trigger the secondary super cinematic. An extra condition for the cinematic to be triggered is also that the first hit of the super connected, but the distance on it is not checked.

### Outlines lie within their boxes/on the edge

If a box's outline is thick, it lies within that box's bounds, meaning that two boxes intersect if either their fills or outlines touch or both. This is relevant for throwboxes too.  
If a box's outline is thin, like that of a pushbox or a clash-only hitbox for example, then that outline lies on the edge of the box. For Jack O's and Bedman's summons the hurtbox's outline may be thin to create less clutter on the screen.

### General notes about throw boxes

If a move has a throw box as well as hitbox - both the hitbox and the throw boxes must connect. By the way, Potemkin Buster's hitbox does not matter - only the throw box (proof: <https://youtu.be/59uc9h6KKIE>).

Answer's and I-No's air command grabs cannot grab behind them.

### Frame-by-frame animation playback

You can force the game to play one frame at a time (in training mode only). You can either use the 'Mod UI - Hitboxes - Freeze Game' checkbox to pause/resume the game and 'Next Frame' button to advance to the next frame, or you can set up hotkeys for those buttons, as described in [Hotkey configuration](#hotkey-configuration).  
Holding directions and attack buttons while advancing to the next frame will produce those inputs on that frame. Playback and recording buttons for controlling the training dummy work while the game is paused, and in order to position reset via Playback + Recording button combination, hold it while advancing to the next frame.

## Default Hotkeys

### F6 - Disable mod

This toggle enables/disables the mod if you don't want to (or can't) load/unload it every time.  
There's also a setting named `startDisabled = false/true` which is a boolean which tells the mod to either be disabled or enabled right when it starts, so that you could start the game with the mod disabled initially.

### F7 - Toggle hitboxes display

Since the `Disable mod` toggle disables the whole mod, this toggle only disables the hitbox drawing, so that GIF mode, No gravity mode, freeze game mode, etc may still work, only the boxes don't display.

### ESC - Show/hide mod's UI

By default when you start the mod it will open a UI window in-game that has all the controls and settings laid out as buttons, checkboxes and fields. To hide the UI you can close it by clicking the x in the top right corner or by pressing ESC (default hotkey). To open the UI again, press ESC (default hotkey). You configure this hotkey and whether the UI opens when you start the mod using `modWindowVisibilityToggle` (in the mod's UI it's under 'Settings - Keyboard Shortcuts - Hide UI Toggle') and `modWindowVisibleOnStart` (in the mod's UI it's under 'Settings - General Settings - Mod Window Visible On Start').

### Hotkey configuration

If you wish to configure hotkeys for Gif mode and No gravity mode and other modes, you can use the mod's UI that you can see in the game's window when you load the mod. The hotkey settings are located there in Settings - Keyboard Shortcuts. All other settings are also located in various parts of the UI. Or you can configure all settings by creating a text file named `ggxrd_hitbox_overlay.ini` and placing it in the directory where the game executable is. For example, for me my Steam version of the game is located at `...\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GUILTY GEAR Xrd -REVELATOR-\Binaries\Win32`.  
Here's an example of the `.ini` file:

<details>
  <summary>Here's an example of the `.ini` file:</summary>

; All of these settings can be changed using the mod's UI which can be seen in the game if you press ESC (default hotkey, can be configured in modWindowVisibilityToggle).

; A keyboard shortcut to toggle GIF mode.
; GIF mode is:
; 1) Background becomes black
; 2) Camera is centered on you
; 3) Opponent is invisible and invulnerable
; 4) Hide HUD (interface)
; GIF Mode can also be toggled using 'UI - Hitboxes - GIF Mode'.
gifModeToggle = 

; A keyboard shortcut to only toggle the "background becomes black" part of the "gifModeToggle".
; Empty by default, which means no hotkey is assigned. Assign your desired hotkey manually here.
; This option can be combined with the other "only" options, by sharing the same key binding for example.
; Black background can also be toggled using 'UI - Hitboxes - Black Background'.
gifModeToggleBackgroundOnly = 

; A keyboard shortcut to toggle the game's Settings - Display Settings - Post-Effect. Changing it this way does not
; require the current match to be restarted.
; Alternatively, you could set the "turnOffPostEffectWhenMakingBackgroundBlack" setting in this INI file to true
; so that whenever you enter either the GIF mode or the GIF mode (black background only), the Post-Effect is

; It may cause lines of hitboxes to not be displayed entirely parallel to the sides of the screen.
; By setting this to true you can force the camera to look straight forward.
; All original hitbox screenshots on dustloop were taken with a slightly angled pitch, so setting this to true
; would produce screenshots different from those of dustloop's.

allowFastForwardOfSupersRoundstartsEtc = true
```

</details>

You can specify a combination of keys, separated by `+` sign. You can assign same key to multiple features - it will toggle/set in motion all of them simultaneously.  
The allowed key names are listed at the start of the sample INI file.

If the mod is already running, you don't need to do anything in order to apply the new hotkeys and settings. The mod can reread the settings on the fly, without reloading the mod or restarting the game (this was tested to work even on Ubuntu/Linux running GGXrd under Steam Proton).

## Framebar

The framebar is displayed by default. To turn it off, you can go to mod's UI - Settings - Framebar Settings - Show Framebar (in the INI it is called 'showFramebar').

![Screenshot can't be viewed](framebar_example.jpg)

Here's a basic rundown of frame colors (there're way more than those listed):

![Screenshot can't be viewed](frames_card.png)

Hovering over a frame in the framebar will display a tooltip with extra information about a frame:

![Screenshot can't be viewed](frame_tooltip.png)

The tooltip includes the name of the current animation, brief or general information about the state of the player on that frame and input history for that frame, among other info.

White ticks inbetween frames (they look like `'`) denote the start of a new animation or an important subsection of an animation.

Frame numbers are displayed on the framebar, showing the number of frames in a span of same-colored frames. By default, frames that have a black triangle in their lower-right corner and denote 'Has whiff cancels' are considered 'same color' as the same-colored frames without that triangle. This can be changed using settings.

By pressing down the left mouse button over one of the frames, holding it and dragging it, you can select a range of frames, and a text telling the count of selected frames will be shown.

The framebar can be repositioned by dragging it anywhere but on the frames (try inbetween the rows of framebars), and it can be resized by dragging its edges, which become visible when dragging it (if the edges are invisible due to you not currently dragging the framebar, they can still be dragged to resize the framebar, you just need to land your mouse on them correctly).

Projectiles on the framebar get their own separate framebars. If the framebar window cannot hold all of the projectile framebars, a vertical scrollbar appears that you can scroll with the mouse wheel or by dragging it.

Once the framebar accumulates more frames than it can display, it circles around, but also a horizontal scrollbar appears, and when it is scrolled, it lets you revert the state of the framebar into the past, up to a certain extent. This can be turned off using settings.

To move the horizontal scrollbar you can either drag it with the left mouse button, or you can hold down Shift and rotate the mouse wheel down.

Framedata in the form of Startup/Active/Recovery/Total/Advantage is shown on top of P1's framebar and under P2's framebar, with projectile framebars going below all that. Framedata display in the framebar can be disabled in the settings.

The height of the rows of framebars can be adjusted using the 'UI - Settings - Framebar Settings - Framebar Height' (INI file - 'framebarHeight'), among other settings.

The framebar skips hitstop, but that can be adjusted using settings. Framebar skips grab animations, which can be adjusted using settings. Framebar also skips superfreeze, and that cannot be adjusted. When skipping a grab or a superfreeze, but not hitstop, a white vertical stitch line will be displayed on the framebar at the place of the skip, and this can be adjusted using settings (including for skipping hitstop).

You can read more about the framebar by going to UI - Settings - Framebar Settings - Framebar Help.

## Position Reset Mod

Position reset mod is disabled by default and must be enabled using 'mod's main window UI - Settings - General Settings - Use Position Reset Mod' setting. In the INI this setting is called 'usePositionResetMod'.

The controls become as follows:

- 2+Reset: non-swapped roundstart position;
- 8+Reset: swapped roundstart position;
- 4+Reset: left corner. Human Player outside the corner, CPU inside;
- 1+Reset: left corner. Human Player inside the corner, CPU outside;
- 6+Reset: right corner. Human Player outside the corner, CPU inside;
- 3+Reset: right corner. Human Player inside the corner, CPU outside;
- 5+Reset: reset to last used position;
- 9+Reset: set current arbitrary position of both players as 'last used position'.

For the corner positions, you can tweak the distance from the corner and the distance between players using the two settings below 'Use Position Reset Mod' in the UI: 'Position Reset Corner - Distance Between Players' and 'Position Reset Corner - Distance From Corner'. In the INI they're called respectively 'positionResetDistBetweenPlayers' and 'positionResetDistFromCorner'.

BIG Thanks to WorseThanYou for making his own, original position reset mod, which was used as the source of information to make this one! You can get his mod at his website: <https://worsety.github.io/>. If you're using his mod, then hitbox_overlay's position reset won't work. All other features of hitbox_overlay will keep working, and WorseThanYou's position reset will keep working together with all the other features of hitbox_overlay.

## Input History Mod

Input history mod is disabled by default and must be enabled using 'mod's main window UI - Settings - General Settings - Display Durations In Input History' setting. In the INI this setting is called 'showDurationsInInputHistory'.

It will modify training mode's and combo mode's display of input history like so:

![Screenshot can't be viewed](input_history.jpg)

You can enable the display of input history in modes like Offline Versus, Episode, Tutorial, Mission, using 'Display Input History In Some Offline Modes Vs CPU' setting (in INI it's called 'displayInputHistoryInSomeOfflineModes').

And by default the display of input history when observing online matches is enabled. You can disable it using the 'Display Input History When Observing' setting (called 'displayInputHistoryWhenObserving' in INI).

## Hide Wins Mod

![Screenshot can't be viewed](wins.jpg)

This sub-mod allows you to hide the wins counters on the rematch screen in online multiplayer. It has the following settings, accessible from the main mod UI window:

Settings - General Settings - ...
1) Hide Wins - On/Off. Hides wins both when playing or observing a game.
2) Hide Wins - Only When Playing - On/Off. Hides wins only when playing a game, not when observing.
3) Hide Wins - Except When N Wins Reached. Enter the number of wins into the textbox. When either player reaches this number of wins, show only those wins. Don't show the other player's wins or if the number of wins didn't change.

You may ask "why". Well, sometimes some people just want to chill out and play some games, not focusing on who won more. Or they're trying to practice wakeup backdash in real combat. Or they changed their controller recently. Seeing enormously skewed wins just puts you in a bad mood for no reason.

## Taking transparent/non-transparent screenshots

The mod allows you to take screenshots of the game with the transparency in the background, with characters overlaid on top without transparency. To achieve that, you need to go into the game's `Display settings` and set `Post-Effect` to `OFF` or the mod can turn it off for you automatically (read below).

![Screenshot can't be viewed](posteffect_off.jpg)

Post-Effect set to Off seems to turn off anti-aliasing, but without it the trick won't work. Then you can load the mod and enter "GIF mode" (has no default hotkey) or "gifModeToggleBackgroundOnly" (no hotkey by default) to make the background black and that would actually make the background transparent - but you can't see that with a naked eye. You need to press "screenshotBtn" (F8, copies to clipboard by default) to take a screenshot and paste it into a graphical editor supporting transparency, like GIMP for example, in order to see transparency.  
Transparency in the game is actually inverted, meaning the background is fully opaque while the characters are (almost) fully transparent. The screenshotter inverts the alpha channel to make it correct. Some parts of the characters might still remain at about 230-254 alpha instead of 255, though, so watch out.

To turn off `Post-Effect` automatically whenever you make the background black, you could set the `turnOffPostEffectWhenMakingBackgroundBlack` setting in the INI file to true (is true by default) or tick the 'Settings - Hitbox Settings - Turn Off Post-Effect When Making Background Black' checkbox (ticked by default). Or, alternatively, you could use the `togglePostEffectOnOff` keyboard shortcut, which is set in the INI file, to turn the Post-Effect on or off manually using a hotkey (the default hotkey is not set) (in UI, it's located in Settings - Keyboard Shortcuts - Toggle Post-Effect On/Off). Turning Post-Effect on/off this way does not require reloading the match! This is much faster than going to the main menu and changing it there!

### Screenshot saving location

By default the mod saves the screenshot into clipboard buffer, meaning you can paste it afterwards into a graphics program which supports transparency. In order to save screenshots to a file or directory you can either specify it in the mod's UI window in its Settings, or you can add the `ggxrd_hitbox_overlay.ini` file into the same folder as the game executable and write the path into the `screenshotPath` setting in it, without quotes. Now when you save multiple screenshots in a row, each consecutive one will get a number in its name, increasing from 1 to infinity. Screenshots are never cleaned up, so if you never clean them up yourself, you might fill up your hard drive.  
The only supported format by the mod is PNG and it uses `libpng` to encode that. You don't need to do anything to install `libpng` since it should come working inside the DLL already.  

### Continuous screenshotting

You can use the `.ini` setting `allowContinuousScreenshotting` to make it so that as you hold down the `screenshotBtn` the screenshots get taken every game frame. This only includes non-frozen and non-paused game frames, i.e. only animation frames that are actually new. This feature only works under following conditions:

- The `screenshotPath` in the `.ini` is not empty;
- It only works in Training mode;
- A match (training session) must currently be running;
- The mod is not currently disabled using `disableModToggle` or `startDisabled`.

There's also a toggle you can use instead of holding down a button, and that toggle is a checkbox in the mod's UI called 'Continuous Screenshotting Mode' or you can also edit the `continuousScreenshotToggle` setting in the `.ini`. It doesn't require `allowContinuousScreenshotting` to be set to `true` in order to work, can be any hotkey and toggles continuous screenshotting on and off, but it still works only under the aforementioned conditions.

### Non-transparent screenshotting

To take regular, non-transparency-enabled screenshots you can set the `dontUseScreenshotTransparency` setting to `true` either through the mod's UI window or in the `.ini` file (which must be placed into the game's folder).

### Converting PNGs into WEBP animation with transparency with ffmpeg

You can use ffmpeg (<https://www.ffmpeg.org/>) to convert multiple PNGs into one animation. Now, GIF could be used but it doesn't support semi-transparency: each pixel in GIF can only be either fully transparent or not transparent at all, which would ruin most animations containing special effects.  
WEBP supports full transparency and is an animation format. The command to transform PNGs into a WEBP is as follows:

```cmd
ffmpeg -framerate 4 -i imageFrameName%d.png -filter:v "crop=out_w:out_h:x:y" -quality 100 -loop 65535 webpFileName.webp
```

Make sure to substitute:  

- `ffmpeg` with the real location to the ffmpeg.exe on your computer;
- `-framerate 4` - make sure to substitute with the desired framerate, the higher the faster;
- `imageFrameName%d.png` with the path to the PNGs that you want to convert. The `%d` is the number part of the filename. So for example, if your PNGs are named like `screen1.png`, `screen2.png`, `screen3.png`, etc you would write here `screen%d.png`;
- `out_w`:`out_h`:`x`:`y` with the width and height of the cropping rectangle, x and y with the x and y of its top-left corner. You can get the bounding rectangle location by doing a selection in GIMP and maybe even in Paint;
- `-quality 100` - can be lowered of course to conserve file size;
- `webpFileName.webp` is the output webp file name. If you replace the `.webp` with `.gif` here and remove the `-quality` option, it might work for a GIF as well;

If any paths contain spaces (to ffmpeg, to the input PNGs, to the output WEBP) you must enclose them in quotation marks.

You can add a frame counter to the bottom of the animation using following ffmpeg command (taken from <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15364861/frame-number-overlay-with-ffmpeg>):

```cmd
ffmpeg -framerate 2 -i imageFrameName%d.png -loop 65535 -vf "drawtext=fontfile=Arial.ttf: text='%{frame_num}': start_number=1: x=(w-tw)/2: y=h-(2*lh): fontcolor=black: fontsize=20: box=1: boxcolor=white: boxborderw=5" -c:a copy webpFileName.webp
```

Here I think `w` in `x=...` means width of the image, and `tw` is the width of the text. `h` is height of the image. Perhaps you can regulate the text position by setting the x and y to literal numbers. I'm sorry, I can't be of much help here.

### Converting PNGs into GIF animation with transparency with ffmpeg

This command takes a set of PNG screenshots labeled "screen1.png", "screen2.png", "screen3.png", etc (it's important that the numbers start from 0 or 1 or somewhere close to that) with transparency and converts them into a GIF with transparency with cropping with given framerate:

First generate a palette, so that we get the best quality of colors:

```cmd
ffmpeg -i screenspath\screen%d.png -vf palettegen=reserve_transparent=1 palettepath\palette.png
```

Not much we can customize in this.  
Then use the source images and the palette to produce a GIF:

```cmd
ffmpeg -framerate 20 -i screenspath\screen%d.png -i palettepath\palette.png -lavfi "crop=out_w:out_h:x:y,paletteuse=alpha_threshold=128:dither=floyd_steinberg" -gifflags -offsetting output\out.gif
```

Here the options you must replace are:

- `ffmpeg` - this is not an option, it's the command to be run, provide the full path to your ffmpeg.exe here;
- `-framerate 20` - replace 20 with desired framerate;
- `screenspath\screen%d.png` - the path to your screenshot PNG files. The %d is the number part of the filename. So for example, if your PNGs are named like screen1.png, screen2.png, screen3.png, etc you would write here screen%d.png;
- `crop=out_w:out_h:x:y` - this is the crop filter and its arguments. What a crop filter does is cut out only a part of the image. You must substitute `out_w` (width), `out_h` (height), `x` (top-left corner x) and `y` (top-left corner y) with the size and position of the cropping rectangle. You can get these positions by selecting a region of the image in GIMP or MSPaint;
- `,` - the `crop` filter and its arguments are then followed by `,`, which separates filters in a filter chain. The crop takes the first `-i` input as its input (crop has only one input) and produces one output. The first output of the `crop` filter and the second `-i` input (which is the palette) then go as inputs to the next, `paletteuse` filter;
- `paletteuse=` - this is the paletteuse filter. It has 2 inputs: a palette and an image. What follows next are its two arguments, separated by `:` (paletteuse can have more arguments specified, but we only specify two);
- `alpha_threshold=128` - this is the first argument (don't confuse 'argument' and 'input') of the `paletteuse` filter. It specifies the cut-off alpha threshold after which the pixel is considered fully transparent. Since there's no partial transparency in GIF - only either full transparency or no transparency - this value is very important if there's partial transparency or some kind of special effects in your animation;
- `dither=floyd_steinberg` - this is the second argument of the `paletteuse` filter. It specifies dithering. Dithering is the process by which all the other colors that are not in the palette are achieved in GIF. Personally I find that the `floyd_steinberg` value produces the best results, but the other values that you could use for `dither` are: `bayer` (fixed grid (static) dithering - the classic look and feel of the GIF format), `none` (no dithering, I guess for when you got the colors in the palette exactly right or for 8-bit images).
- `gifflags`, `offsetting` - I don't know what these mean, got them from <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53566442/ffmpeg-gif-with-transparency-from-png-image-sequence>;
- `output\out.gif` - the path to the GIF output file.

Again, if any paths contain spaces, you must enclose them in quotes. You can read about ffmpeg filter syntax on: <https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#toc-Filtering-Introduction>  
I will add that `-lavfi`, `-filter_complex`, `-vf`, `-af`, `-filter` mean exactly the same thing, which is a filtergraph (see ffmpeg documentation mentioned above). `:v` usually means the video part of an input, `:a` means the audio part of an input.

## Renumbering frames and changing framerate of a subrange of frames in a GIF

The tools provided in <https://github.com/kkots/GIFTools> allow renumbering PNG files in a PNG sequence and altering individual GIF frame lengths through a console (non-graphical) interface.

## Developing

### How to clone this repo

This git repo has a submodule for `imgui`. To clone this repo you can either follow this guide: <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>  
Or use command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kkots/ggxrd_hitbox_overlay_2211.git
```

This will create a subfolder called `ggxrd_hitbox_overlay_2211` in your current directory, download the mod's files into it, in that folder there will be another folder called `imgui` and that will contain the files for the version of imgui that we use.

### Project structure

There are multiple separate projects in the repository.

The `ggxrd_hitbox_injector` project builds an application that will inject a dll into the process and exit. The main action will then take place in the dll, in the target process' address space.

The `ggxrd_hitbox_overlay` project builds the dll that's responsible for drawing the hitboxes.

The `ggxrd_hitbox_patcher_console` project is cross-platform, but is intended exclusively for Ubuntu/Linux and does the same thing as `ggxrd_hitbox_patcher`.

 The `ggxrd_hitbox_patcher` is a desktop window application project that is intended exclusively for Windows and patches the GuiltyGearXrd.exe executable so that it launches the mod's overlay DLL on startup. This is needed in case injector doesn't work on Ubuntu/Linux (there is a launcher script for it though, try that).

Each project should have its own separate README.md.

The `libpng` series of projects is an outside repository that we depend on. The reason this is a fork and not the original repository is because I needed to retarget its Visual Studio projects since I didn't have the older build tools.

`imgui` is an outside project that we depend on, it's included in this mod as a git submodule. Please do not modify anything there and try not to update it using git fetch or git pull, unless you're ready to make corresponding changes in our mod.

`detours` is Microsoft Detours library, also included as a git submodule. The reason this is a fork and not the original repository is because I needed to remove samples from compilation: they were giving trouble to some people.

`zlib` is a compression library needed for libpng. It is included as a git submodule here. Please also refrain from modifying it.

`JWasm` is an x86 assembler that supports MASM syntax. It is only needed to compile the asmhooks.asm file for the DLL part of the mod on Linux. <https://github.com/JWasm/JWasm> You won't find it in the project structure on Windows, because it only gets downloaded by the DLL project's build.py script on Linux.

The dependency projects are better described in [Development dependencies](#development-dependencies).

## Development dependencies

Dependencies are better described in each project's README.md. Short version is, the project depends on:

- Microsoft Detours library: <https://github.com/microsoft/Detours> Used for hooking functions. We need the 32-bit (x86) statically linked library of it. It is included in the mod as a git submodule: <https://github.com/microsoft/Detours.git>.
  If you run into the problem that Detours rebuilds itself and all its samples each time you try to build the ggxrd_hitbox_overlay project, try replacing the Makefile located in SOLUTION_ROOT/Detours/Makefile with an empty file. Do not commit this change to the Detours repository, either locally or remotely.

- `dxsdk` - repository version of Microsoft's Direct3D 9 SDK. Needed for the `d3dx9.h` header file. The repo is included in this mod as a git submodule: <https://github.com/apitrace/dxsdk.git>

- `libpng` - a PNG encoder library. This is needed for the transparent screenshotting functionality. You should statically link its 32-bit verion into this mod, it's included in the mod as a git submodule, pointing to my fork of it. libpng homepage: <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html>. libpng github repository: <https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng>. Fork repository: <https://github.com/kkots/libpng>

- `zlib` - a compression library needed for libpng. You should statically link its 32-bit verion into this mod, it's included in the mod as a git submodule: <https://github.com/madler/zlib.git>

- `imgui` - a graphical user interface library for C++. This is used to draw the mod's UI using Direct3D 9 API in the overlay, inside the game. The sources of imgui are included in this mod as a git submodule: <https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git>.

- `D3DCompiler_43.dll` - used for compiling a custom pixel shader. A .LIB file for it, d3dcompiler.lib, is taken from Microsoft's legacy DirectX Software Development Kit and included in this project in the `d3d9` folder. The .LIB file allows the functions from the DLL to be used directly, without LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress, and the DLL itself, which gets loaded by the mod on startup automatically, is shipped with Guilty Gear Xrd and resides in its Binaries\\Win32 folder.

- `D3DX9_43.dll` - used for matrix math. It is used by the project the exact same way as D3DCompiler_43.dll, and its .LIB file is d3dx9.lib.

- `JWasm` - used to assemble the asmhooks.asm file for the DLL part of the mod on Linux. <https://github.com/JWasm/JWasm> This dependency is not used for running the mod (neither on Windows nor on Linux or Wine or otherwise), only building, and only on Linux.

## Mod compatibility

If trying to use the mod with a game version that it doesn't fit, the game may crash. The version of the game it's meant for is 2211. This is the number that is displayed in the bottom right corner of the main menu screen after you launch the game.

The mod should be possible to combine with other mods, but there might be some mods that can't be combined with this one (if they hook or sigscan the same functions).

This mod is totally compatible with:

- Loj's Replay Takeover: <https://github.com/ibrow19/GGXrdReplayTakeover>
- PCvolt's Labtool: <https://github.com/PCvolt/rev2-Labtool>
- Iquis' Wakeup Tool: <https://github.com/Iquis/rev2-wakeup-tool>
- GGXrdMirrorColorSelect: <https://github.com/kkots/GGXrdMirrorColorSelect>
- GGXrdAdjustConnectionTiers: <https://github.com/kkots/GGXrdAdjustConnectionTiers>
- GGXrdFasterLoadingTimes: <https://github.com/kkots/GGXrdFasterLoadingTimes>
- GGXrdAutomaticallyChangeAudioDevice: <https://github.com/kkots/GGXrdAutomaticallyChangeAudioDevice>
- GGXrdChangeBorderlessWindowPos: <https://github.com/kkots/GGXrdChangeBorderlessWindowPos>
- Worse Than You's delay mod patch and all of his other patches. If WorseThanYou's position reset patch is applied, then this mod's position reset mod will silently not work, and everything else will work fine, and WorseThanYou's patch will keep working together with all the other features of this mod.
- Whatever you run on Cheat Engine (unless you patch the functions I need)
- OBS, Windows Gamebar, Nvidia Shadowplay, other recording software
- Steam overlay and anything that Steam does

All of the mods mentioned above are also compatible with each other.

The following mods are incompatible and will refuse to work properly and crash:

- Freecam mod: <https://github.com/kkots/ggxrd_freecam>

This is caused by those mods hooking the same functions as hitbox overlay.

Mods that are likely not compatible and may or will crash (I'm going to be honest, I haven't recently tested these, but remember them crashing when combined with this):

- Replay mod: <https://github.com/kkots/ggxrd_replay_mod>

Iffy, 50/50, haven't tested yet but likely to crash or not work properly:

- Pangaea's Guilty Gear Rev2 Mod: <https://github.com/super-continent/ggxrd-mod>  
It hooks the same functions that I use, namely FN_DEINIT_GAMESTATE. It might be possible to first load their mod, then mine, because I sigscan a small portion of the function that doesn't change after anyone's hook. If you load my mod first, their mod won't find the function.

In a bright future where the Detours library evolves to have a ~~brain~~ ~~*mandatory DLL*~~ *struct with information that we can reach from a hook and confirm it using a magic number*, and creates detouring functions that allow multiple ~~modders~~ *hackers* to sigscan and hook the same function without getting stupid conflicts, combining all mods will be possible. (Also sigscans need to not break when someone hooks something or modifies the code, but you have to create a copy of the entire EXE in RAM for this so it's a long shot.)

## Changelog

- 2023 October 13: Now hitboxes belonging to the same group may be displayed as a single shape with one combined outline;
- 2023 October 16: Added Unicode support to the injector, meaning you should be able to include any non-english characters in the path to the directory in which the injector and the .dll reside;  
                   Tweaked hitbox drawing so that outlines always draw on top of all hitboxes, hitboxes always draw on top of all hurtboxes.  
                   Restricted the hitbox drawing to only non-online matches until I figure out a way to tell if Chipp is doing the invisibility thing in an online match, in which case his boxes should not display.
- 2023 October 21: Now boxes won't be drawn for Chipp & his projectiles in online mode if he's invisible. The mod in all other cases will display boxes in online mode.  
                   Thanks to WorseThanYou's help, added counterhit state to hurtboxes. Your hurtbox will be blue if, should you get hit, you will be in a counter hit state.  
                   Boxes now don't show if a menu is open or an Instant Kill cutscene is currently playing.  
                   Now hitboxes show only during active frames, i.e. there's no longer a problem of them showing during recovery. Hitboxes never show as transparent, only filled in.  
                   Hitboxes keep showing even after an attack connects, as long as the attack's active frames are going on.  
                   Millia's Tandem Top and Sol's Gunflame now show hitbox for a brief period after hitting a target so you could actually see the hitbox on hit.  
                   Added invulnerability check related to startup of supers, such as May's temper tantrum, and possibly many other moves.  
                   Added invulnerability check related to throws but it's incomplete yet, Slayer still shows up as vulnerable for the remainder of his ground throw.  
                   You can now unload the dll after it has been loaded, reverting the game back to normal without having to restart it.  
                   Added proper hitbox display for attached entities like Ky's, I-No's and Millia's Dust (5D) attacks.
- 2023 October 27: Major refactoring.  
                   Fixed hitboxes display for rotated projectiles like Ky's Stun Edge. Previously it was showing as rotated boxes which is not how the game actually checks if it hits. Now it's showing as a box ladder which is correct.  
                   Now while doing a throw you display as strike invulnerable throughout the entire duration of the throw, not just part of it.  
                   Made counterhit state not display if you're strike invulnerable.  
                   Made counterhit state not display on summons or anyone but the main player entities.  
                   Added pushboxes.  
                   Fixed an issue when all boxes were always drawn twice per frame, making them more opaque. Now they should be more transparent.  
                   Moved the binaries into Github's Releases section of this project.
- 2023 October 28: Added gray boxes which are the previous arrangement of the hurtbox that was before the moment it got hit by an attack.  
                   Added missing throw invulnerability checks.  
                   Added throw boxes.  
                   Made Ky's grinders display as strike invulnerable.  
                   Made Jack-O's and Bedman's summons display extra transparent.  
                   Made counterhit display for longer on the one who got hit.  
                   Fixed an error when after some computer restarts signatures wouldn't be found anymore.  
- 2023 October 31: Added rejection boxes that only show up when rejecting projectiles, as normal hits get rejected no matter the distance.  
                   Removed counterhit prolonged display, meaning it no longer still displays you as being in counterhit state after you get hit. This is because counterhit state display is for when you haven't got hit yet, but would enter counterhit state should you get hit.  
                   Removed hitbox showing from episode mode interludes, intro cinematics, before the match starts and on victory/defeat screen. Hitboxes still show during roundend screenfreeze.  
                   Fixed Chipp invisibility in online mode so that only the opponent's invisible Chipp doesn't display boxes. Previously you couldn't see even your own Chipp's boxes if you went invisible. Thanks to WorseThanYou for finding the value to tell which side you're on in online mode.  
                   Fixed an issue when gray boxes (from before the hit) were showing even if you were strike invulnerable at the moment of the hit, meaning you didn't actually get hit. Also fixed gray boxes so that their outlines now show behind the real hurtbox's outlines.  
                   Fixed prolonged hitbox display for Chipp's Gamma Blade, so now the hitbox doesn't immediately disappear as soon as Gamma Blade hits.  
                   Fixed gray boxes still showing after IK cutscene.  
                   Fixed pause menu falsely being reported as open after some computer and game restarts.

- 2023 November 20: Added the `drawPushboxCheckSeparately` mode which breaks throw boxes into two parts: pushbox-proximity-checking and origin-point-checking.
- 2023 November 21: Added reverse chroma key to the transparent screenshotting, so that pixels that have non-black color but 0 alpha still get some alpha.
- 2023 November 26: Made real-time continuous screenshotting absolutely frame-precise, meaning hitboxes always match positions of the sprites displayed on the screen.
- 2023 November 29: Fixed a crash when quitting a match/training session while the mod is running.
- 2023 December 12: Made some fixes in code related to thread safety.

- 2024 January 19: Fixed hitbox display disabling/enabling during frame freeze mode.
- 2024 January 26: Added a toggle to hide the hud only/separated hud out of the "GIF mode". Fixed an issue when rapidly freezing/unfreezing the game made the hitboxes desync from the visuals.
- 2024 September 16: Added imGui.
- 2024 September 24: Fixed some animations still playing in frame freeze mode and playing too fast is slow-mo mode. Fixed danger time countdown playing during frame freeze mode. Fixed Johnny coins and stunmash indicator not displaying in frame freeze mode and displaying glitchily in slow-mo mode. Fixed play, record and backspace buttons not working in frame freeze and slow-mo modes. Draw hitboxes and imgui under steam overlay instead of on top. Not interfere with OBS recording. Can now hide ky sword lightning and >50 tension sparkles in gif mode. Fixed johnny coins, jacko organ cooldown indicators, jam powerup icons not being hidden in gif mode.
- 2024 October 3: drawing hitboxes underneath not just steam overlay, but the in-game pause menu and training HUD, while the origin point is still drawn on top of training HUD, but underneath the pause menu. Added in-game icons to imgui window. Fixed Potemkin IK throwbox, which also fixed throwboxes for Sol Riot Stamp, maybe Potemkin ICPM if it wasn't showing before (now it does), maybe other moves that grab you on hit. Fixed 6P+H,5 (blitz input by pressing 6P+H and immediately releasing 6) displaying a throw which is active for 2 frames which is incorrect - throw is actually active for 1 frame. Changed how backside and upside Ky's Ride the Lightning hitboxes display - they're "clash only". Similarly for Jack O Aegis Field hitbox. Hiding boxes on Slayer's forward and back dashes in online mode for the sake of making it a guess which side he's teleporting to. Fixed Dizzy Reflect hitbox - it was not visible.
- 2024 October 20: added missing check for full invul that happens during clash hitstop.
- 2024 October 23: fixed missing hitboxes for Dizzy's bubble pop
- 2024 October 30: added toggleCameraCenterOpponent setting into INI and the UI to center camera on the opponent. Added a toggle and setting to hide the player. Added a toggle to disable gray hurtboxes. In other words, you can now screenshot hurtboxes of the dummy during hitstun and blockstun.
- 2024 November 12: made hitboxes' outline change to black when drawing over similarly colored background. For example, previously, when the character is red, the hitbox outline would not be visible on top of them, but now the outline will be black in this particular case.
- 2024 December: Fixed the display of invulnerability after rejecting something with a Blitz Shield - there's no longer one frame of supposed vulnerability (in reality, you can do backdash/DP/Super from a reject and not be vulnerable for a single frame).
- 2025 January 1-7: Removed Y check from some command grabs that are ground-only, except Genrou Zan. Added a new type of boxes/circles that are white - interaction boxes/circles, and projectile origin points.
- 2025 February 1: can now use gamepad buttons and inputs as hotkeys
- 2025 February 7: Version 6.0. Releasing framebar, framedata display, with input history mod and position reset mod
- 2025 February 8: Version 6.1. Added horizontal scrollbar to framebar, fixed crash in online, added framedata display on top of and under player framebars
- 2025 February 9: Version 6.2. Fixed behavior of 'Show Player In Framebar Title' being off (displayed "???" in the titles for P1's and P2's framebars).
                   Fixed mouse cursor position not being in sync with where the mod's UI thinks it is on 1440p resolution in windowed mode
- 2025 February 10: Version 6.3: Fixed mouse cursor position not being in sync with where the mod's UI thinks it is (again)
- 2025 February 10: Version 6.4: Fixed display of frame advantage in framebar for moves that are very minus (previously was showing '?')
- 2025 February 10: Version 6.5: Fixed red/green color for landing frame advantage (displayed in '(...)') in the framebar
- 2025 February 10: Version 6.6: Fixed framebar displaying the very first frame on the far right instead of at the start
- 2025 February 12: Version 6.7: Added interaction box (white) for Leo bt.D successful parry that shows the distance where the opponent's origin point must be in order to get vaccuumed. Fixed the active frames of I-No ground Sterilization Method (previously was not registering any active frames.). Added a toggle to disable particle effect creation, to get cleaner screenshots of just the models.
- 2025 February 15: Version 6.8: Added info in frame tooltip about when Sin enters starving animation and can't RC it. Added Johnny Mist Finer Level to Johnny's Character Specific UI window.
- 2025 February 16: Version 6.9: Fixing mistakes: Stagger animation was erroneously displaying as throw invulnerable. Projectiles that hit on the same frame as they get created and instantly disappear, would show up on the framebar, but their name would always be just "Projectiles". Name of such projectiles displays correctly now.
- 2025 February 16: Version 6.10: Fix framebar and/or mod's UI not displaying when hitbox display is turned off, in both OBS dodging mode and without it.
- 2025 February 20: Version 6.11: Fixed crash when an Elphelt shotgun is fired in observer multiplayer or single player modes.
- 2025 February 20: Version 6.12: Fixed framebar emptying when a player died by DoT.
- 2025 February 21: Version 6.13: Fixed input history reverting to an older state on round end.
- 2025 February 25: Version 6.14: Fixed a potential issue of the patcher not working with ASLR, and projectile framebars sometimes appearing even if empty.
- 2025 March 4: Version 6.15: Fixed Carcass Raid name being in slang (for ex. "S Carcass", no Raid) even when slang names are turned off. Made framebar not display in offline human versus human. Added 64-bit injector and modified .sh script for Linux so that it chooses 64-bit or 32-bit injector based on whether the Wine prefix is 64-bit or 32-bit. Started self-signing the injector, the DLL, and the patcher, and added VERSIONINFO to all of them, replaced most function calls in the injector with GetProcAddress with name obfuscation, in the hopes that it will reduce the frequency of Windows Defender aggro.
- 2025 March 7: Version 6.16: Removed commandline versions of the injector and the patcher and replaced them with window versions in hopes of avoiding virus detection. The injector and the patcher will now have their versions numbered separately from the DLL, starting from "mk2". The Linux patcher will still be commandline based.
- 2025 March 8: Version 6.16 mk3: Fixed a situation in the window versions of patcher and injector where you could get stuck after having pressed Enter after a "Press Enter to exit..." prompt. Patcher will now print errors if it failed to open the GuiltyGearXrd.exe file instead of simply saying "Press Enter to exit...". None of these issues affect the Linux version of the patcher.
- 2025 March 19: Version 6.17:
  1) Fixed an issue when if showFramebarInOtherModes setting is true, framebar would get stuck on screen after finishing a non-observer online match in a rematch lobby.
  2) Added Combo Recipe panel.
  3) Added "Combo Damage & Combo Stun" panel which displays the total achieved combo stun and combo damage.
  4) Fixed an issue when some moves that can have multiple names (like May 6H, May Max 6H, etc) would select and show an incorrect version of the name all the time.
  5) Remade the 'Move' field: now it does not split supers into two different moves (before superfreeze and after superfreeze).
  6) Added tooltips to the left and to the right of the 'Startup' and 'Total' fields and if you hover over the title of the field itself as well, which shows the names of moves or parts of moves that make up the startup or the total, with the exact duration of each part.
  7) Fixed an issue when projectiles that disappear on hit during superfreeze, specifically Red Hail balls, would initially display '???' in the corresponding framebar's title.
  8) Added more names to Venom Balls, now Bishop Runout and Red Hail balls are distinguished by name in the framebar, Sol Gunflame done from a dash will be named Runflame, added distinguishment in the name of the move between Tap, Charge and Max Charge Blitz Shields, added distinguishment in the name of the move between Slayer Pilebunker, Crosswise Heel and Under Pressure done from P Dandy Step and K Dandy Step.
  9) Added a checkbox that turns on a feature that makes the game ignore either the main Enter key, or the numpad Enter key, or none, or both.
  10) In the Cancels panel, if a super or Blitz Shield is performed, fixed the name of the move showing "(frames 1+)" at the end. Now, first off, it won't even break supers into two moves, and moves that are broken up, will display frame ranges correctly.
  11) In the 'Invul' field and in invul description in a frame's tooltip will now print an extra "can't armor overdrives" if it's not clear enough that the super armor can't armor overdrives.
  12) Added a tooltip for the 'Stun' field that explains how stun decays.
  13) Added a 'Weight' field to the "Speed/Hitstun Proration/..." panel.
  14) If 'Show debug fields' checkbox is checked, will now show a 'trial' name in the 'Anim' field in parentheses, if present. For example, Venom Bishop Runout and Red Hail balls have 'trial' names.
  15) "Damage/RISC/Stun Calculation" panels have been swapped for Player 1 and Player 2. Now you need to click the player that was the attacker to see what damage their hits dealt.
- 2025 March 20: Version 6.18:
  1) The feature that lets you ignore Enter key presses will now only work during matches, except when observing an online match or replay mode.
  2) Fixed a situation which happened while the checkbox 'Combine Projectile Framebars When Possible' is checked (which is the default), in which repeat projectiles like DI Ground Viper Explosions would associate themselves with a framebar of another projectile, like a Gold Burst for example, and then the next projectiles of the exact same type (more explosions) would refuse to go onto that framebar and instead place themselves onto a new one, thus having 2 framebars shown for DI Ground Viper Explosions, which should all be on one framebar.
  3) Combo Recipe panel will autoscroll to the bottom whenever a new action is added to it.
  4) Fixed an issue when using the search button would permanently render all elements stuck close to each other horizontally until the mod is uninjected and injected again. Also when using the search outside of a match, the game would crash.
- 2025 March 22: Version 6.19: Fixed an issue when hitboxes would be drawn fully transparent while OBS is on, OBS dodging is enabled and either alt-tabbing during fullscreen is performed, or the Windows machine is unlocked, or resolution is changed. Fixed the 'Micordash' typo. Combo Recipe panel now registers microwalks.
- 2025 March 28: Version 6.20:
  1) Added Baiken Tsurane Sanzu-watashi interaction (white) box.
  2) Fixed Combo Recipe not registering Ground/Air Throw if it's the first hit in a combo.
  3) In the 'Tension Values' panel, inside the comment for its 'Tension Gain On Attack' field, added a list of ranges of values of Tension Pulse and their corresponding tension gain modifiers.
  4) Combo Recipe now displays delay cancels and idle times. The display of delay cancels, idle times, microwalks and microdashes can be turned off, each separately.
  5) The 'Combo Damage & Combo Stun' panel now displays the tension gained by you and the burst gained by your opponent during the last combo.
  6) There is a new setting in Settings - General Settings, called 'Starting Tension Pulse', ranging from -25000 to 25000, which lets you set the initial Tension Pulse upon stage reset in Training Mode.
  7) Fixed Combo Recipe panel registering I-No's dash twice.
- 2025 March 28: Version 6.21:
  1) The Combo Recipe panel will now ignore jump or superjump installs selectively depending on the move that is being (super)jump installed. There is a new setting to not display super jump installs. Jump installs now won't be registered more than once during the same string of moves (unless it's a super jump install followed by a regular jump install). Jump installs now won't be registered for Bedman at all.
  2) Fixed Jack-O 5H not displaying special cancels in the framebar or the Cancels panel.
  3) Added a new display to the framebar tooltips: they now show the dust combo gatling cancel timer. While this timer is above zero, if any normal attack connects, all the non-followup non-super non-IK moves get added as gatlings.
  4) Fixed a problem when delay cancels would not be displayed correctly for some moves if there're more than 30 cancels available from a move.
  5) Added Double Jumps and Airdashes count display to the 'Speed/Hitstun Proration/...' panel.
- 2025 March 30: Version 6.22: Fixed projectile framebars that already disappeared out of view not reappearing when scrolling the framebar into the past. This error was there since version 6.18 inclusive.
- 2025 April 10: Version 6.23: Displays duration of rejection. Previously was displaying incorrect value of "hitstun".
- 2025 April 23: Version 6.24: Box Extents panel now displays throw ranges.
- 2025 April 27: Version 6.25: Made Combo Damage panel transparent. Now displays Silent Force re-pick in Combo Recipe and in framebar. Added an option to make Combo Recipe panel display with a transparent background - the option is inside the Combo Recipe panel's gear button. Added pushbox width and height display to Box Extents panel.
- 2025 April 27: Version 6.26: Register Silent Force re-pick when it's done as soon as the knife is able to be picked up.
- 2025 April 28: Version 6.27: Made the text outline be of higher quality in the Combo Recipe panel when it's in transparent background mode and in the Combo Damage panel.
- 2025 August 29: Version 6.28:
1) Modified how hitboxes display for rotated projectiles. In particular, there was an inconsistency spotted with Ky's Aerial H Stun Edge hitbox: it was shown by the hitbox overlay as horizontal, while in reality it is vertical.
2) Fixed pushboxes being incorrect for many, many moves. They were not taking into account that many moves elongate pushboxes horizontally, and now they do. Examples of such moves are Jam f.S, Baiken Air Tatami Gaeshi.
3) Brought back Bedman Deja Vu Task C and D hitboxes that had been missing since version 6.0.
4) (Ver. 6.28 and 6.29 have Ms. Travailler charge powerup display 1f later, later versions have not.) Made Elphelt's Ms. Confille Maximum Charge powerup be displayed not when the reticle becomes full-sized, but when firing the rifle (Ver. 6.28 and 6.29) "on this frame" (in later versions it is "on the next frame") would fire it just in time for the reticle to become full-sized, i.e. slightly in advance (rifle startup is 3).
5) Previously, framebar was displaying the pre-landing frame as landing recovery (purple), if you got hit on it. This would only happen if you were also performing an air normal on that frame, even if that air normal had no landing recovery attached to it. Now, that frame will display as getting hit during regular recovery, startup or active frames - whatever is supposed to be at that time.
6) Fixed throw invulnerability being displayed on the frame on which you got grabbed - which contradicts the fact that you got grabbed on that frame. Also, certain throws like Ky's ground throw were not showing the one being thrown as strike invulnerable all the way through the animation, leading to a potential confusion that it might be possible to hit them with projectiles during that period. You can't. This is now fixed, and strike invulnerability will be shown on more frames of animations of getting thrown. The one who is performing the throw will still be displayed strike and throw invulnerable on their first frame. Additionally, now, when Jam parries a hit, the framebar frame, on which the parry connected, will display her as having super armor and not (yet) having strike+throw invul due to full invul from the parry (though having throw invul is still possible from previous hitstun, blockstun or wakeup, and that will be displayed). Similarly, Blitz Shield reject now will show the defender having super armor on the frame when the attacker's hit connected. Previously, it was displaying full (stirke+throw) invul, which should only start on the frame after.
7) All airborne moves and moves that started on the ground, but immediately (frame 1) went airborne, will now display "airborne" invul in the framebar and the main UI panel's "Invul" field. Previously, only moves that started on the ground (and did not frame 1 become airborne) were doing so. Reminder that airborne moves are able to show landing recovery, while ground moves display landing recovery as regular recovery, and this rule will stay in place. Additionally, moves like Ky's ground H Vapor Thrust, which can be strike invul and airborne simultaneously, will now be able to show both these invuls on the same frame, instead of just one or the other (previously, these types of invul were shown mutually exclusively: either only strike, or only airborne - for no reason).
8) Added a button and a hotkey to clear input history, and a checkbox for always clearing it on stage reset in any game mode, and another checkbox for clearing it on stage reset only in training mode. This will also work with "Display Durations In Input History".
9) Added new checkboxes into Hitboxes section for making you or the opponent fully invulnerable without hiding them or making them incapable of landing attacks of their own.
10) Fixed a bug when all framebars would disappear during I-No's Ultimate Fortissimo if it dealt the killing blow.
11) On the framebar, replaced half-colored green frames for Answer's air scroll set with fully colored green frames, as no whiff cancels are actually available.
12) Now, projectiles that disappear when their player is hit, if they're still active at the moment their player is hit, will display one more active frame on that frame. Previously, they would only show that active frame if they hit someone or something. Now they can show it even on whiff. This is relevant for Ky j.D, for example. This will affect both the display of hitboxes and the display of active frames in the framebar and the framedata.
13) Thanks to Worse Than You, fixed an issue when AMD cards could not draw outlines due to the pixel shader that is used to draw them. You can still manually disable the pixel shader in Settings - Hitbox Settings - Use Pixel Shader, which disables black-coloring of outlines over places where the background would otherwise be the same color as the line.
14) The outlines of hitboxes display in black color when on top of same colored background in order to improve their visibility. This feature has now been made more aggressive and black color will appear at larger color differences. You can disable this feature by unchecking Settings - Hitbox Settings - Use Pixel Shader.
15) Renamed Sol's "Break" projectile to "Break Explosion".
16) Added an untested, unconfirmed fix for a crash that happened when one user tried injecting the mod.
17) Fixed input history being visible on the rematch screen when you're not an observer and 'Settings - General Settings - Display Input History When Observing' is checked.
18) Added an option to hide wins on the rematch screen (see [Hide Wins Mod](#hide-wins-mod)). And another option to hide rank icons (circle, arrow up/down, equal sign) next to players (enable in General Settings).
19) Removed all default hotkeys, except:
- ESC: show/hide mod UI.
- F6: disable whole mod.
- F7: show/hide hitboxes.  
This won't affect existing users who update the mod (if they ever changed any settings at all), only new users.
20) Added a missing keyboard shortcut setting into mod's UI: Settings - Keyboard Shortcuts - Disable Mod Toggle. Previously, you could only configure this hotkey through the INI file.
21) Added a text to the framebar tooltip telling after which frame Millia's Secret Garden becomes able to stay if you RC it. The text only shows on that one particular frame.
22) Added a new text to the framebar's frame tooltip, that shows up only if some currently active projectiles would disappear on hit or block for that player. It tells you that "Projectile X will disappear if Character Name is hit/blocks on this frame/at any time." It may be incorrect if Rev1 is selected.
23) Fixed the first framebar frame of Eddie not showing his animation name.
24) Fixed the "Can YRC, and projectile/powerup will stay" message on the framebar tooltip when hovering over Potemkin Trishula frames. The message was previously showing on frame 19 of Trishula, while it should be on frame 20 instead.
25) Fixed a crash caused by hovering over a framebar frame of a move happening during 5D horizontal hoverdash. It was caused by there being more gatlings available than the pre-allocated memory can store. The crash could only happen on larger screen resolutions where more than 30 gatlings could actually fit in the displayed list.
26) Added a display for gatlings from a Blitz Shield reject to the framebar tooltips and 'Cancels' panel.
27) Fixed hitstop display in framebar tooltips showing time remaining / time max without account for the RC slowdown. Now the displayed times will be larger when slowed down by RC.
28) Fixed an incorrect idle frame displayed in framebar when recovering from a Blitz Shield reject while being slowed down by RC.
29) Made framebar less blurry when it's upscaled, for example on higher resolutions, and changed its font for the numbers drawn inside/on top of individual frames.
30) Added settings to control the amount of vertical spacing (empty space) between individual framebars.
31) Added an option to fuse all projectile framebars of each player into a single framebar, located on top of Player 1's main framebar or below Player 2's framebar. From now, this option will be the default for new users of the mod. Also added a second field for entering the framebar height, separating the framebar heights of the player framebars from the projectile framebars.
32) Now framebar tooltip on combined projectile framebars will show individual projectiles, the animation and data for each. This allows you to not lose the details of each projectile when using the new option described in the previous point. This new tooltip format will, however, group projectiles that all have the exact same data, instead of repeating it.
33) Now Combo Recipe panel can display the number of hits performed by a move (can be turned off in the cogwheel). Cancelling from a multi-hit move no longer shows up with a (Delay ?f), if the cancel was not actually delayed after the last hit.
34) Added new settings into "General Settings" which allow you to change online input delay to a value between 0 and 4. Has different values for fullscreen mode and non-fullscreen (windowed, fullscreen windowed) mode.
35) For Bedman's Task A, Task A', Task B, Task C and their Deja Vus added information to the frame tooltips stating on which frames what operations (deactivate, recreate, make invulnerable, make vulnerable again) are performed on the corresponding Seals. Added "(Invulnerable)" indicator next to seal timers in both Character Specific panel and in frame tooltips. Corrected the frame tooltip info about Bedman's inability to airdash. Firstly, it was checking the wrong height, and secondly, Bedman has a Hover instead of airdash.
36) Changed the default option of 'Dodge OBS Recording' from being on to being off.
37) Added "Burst Gain Per Second" field to the "Burst Gain" panel.
38) Now when Playback and Record buttons are pressed during Freeze Game mode, they will start playback or recording immediately, while the game is still paused. Exception to this is pressing those buttons together. Such presses will translate to the next frame, if buttons are still held at the moment of advancing to the next frame, as it worked before the update.
39) Added two new checkboxes in General Settings: to make P1 be the Arcade Boss in Training Mode and P2 be that.
40) Framebar tooltips now display which exact projectiles or powerups were created or achieved on any given frame, instead of just a general "Created a projectile/powerup on this frame". Also instead of "Can YRC, and projectile/powerup will stay" it will stay what exactly will stay if you YRC.
41) Sped up the loading time of the mod by storing some reusable info in ggxrd_hitbox_overlay_sigscanCache.txt file created in the game's Binaries/Win32 folder. You can disable this in the INI file by setting 'useSigscanCaching' to false or through mod's UI - Settings - General Settings - Use Sigscan Caching.
42) Now when Venom hits or activates his own balls using attacks or other projectiles, it will be shown on the framebar using the same white outline and frame tooltip that is used for "A hit connected on this frame". Added similar display for Elphelt shooting own grenade. Added "Can YRC, and projectile/powerup will stay" frame tooltip on Venom ball sets.
43) Repeat Ramlethal Calvados and Trance hits now combine in the Combo Recipe panel. Fixed "Can YRC, and projectile/powerup will stay" frame tooltip on sword summons and Calvados. Made the total frame counter in Ramlethal's Character Specific for the S and the H swords display the total hitstun or blockstun duration of a given sword if it enters those animations (reels back, falls on the ground, etc). Added "(Invulnerable)" indicator next to sword timers in both Character Specific and in frame tooltips.
44) Split Sin hunger animation's recovery and total frames from the main move's recovery and total frames in the main UI's Recovery and Total fields, and on the framebar they will be split using the ' marker with same consecutive frames counter restarting on the framebar. Added "Can YRC, and projectile/powerup will stay" frame tooltip for Sin's Eat moves.
45) Added "active"/"inactive" display for Jack-O's Aegis Field in both the Character Specific panel and in frame tooltips, and when it is inactive it will have a counter until it becomes active again.
46) Added hitstun display for the portion of the Wallslump animation when it has fully descended onto the floor into both the main UI and into frame tooltips.
47) Added "Crouching state" display, which works the same as "Counterhit state" display in frame tooltips. Additionally, made upper body invul and above waist invuls able to be displayed on crouching moves. This is because some moves like Greed Sever set crouching state on themselves somewhere after the start of the move, and moves like Ky Stun Dipper aren't crouching state at all, making omission of upper body and waist invul highly confusing.
48) For Haehyun fixed super tuning balls' remaining time sometimes not being shown in Character Specific, and added tuning ball's remaining time, time until can do another tuning ball and super tuning balls' remaining times into frame tooltips.
- 2025 September 1: Version 6.29:
49) Added Dizzy Ice Spike, Fire Pillar and Ice Scythe and Fire Scythe and Bubble and Fire Bubble "Can YRC, and projectile/powerup will stay" framebar tooltips.
50) Added Baiken j.D "Can YRC, and projectile/powerup will stay" frame tooltip.
51) Fixed damage calculation for hellfire supers in "Damage/RISC/Stun Calculation" panel. Previously was ignoring hellfire if hp was > 10%.
52) Compared to version 6.28, fixed a crash caused by certain projectiles not having a name in the framebar at all.
- 2025 October 10: Version 7.0:
53) Added a list of projectiles Potemkin can flick to his Character Specific panel. Same for Faust, Zato, Leo, Dizzy (Zato, Leo and Dizzy share the same projectiles list).
54) Fixed higher level projectiles clashing with lower level projectiles being displayed in the framebar as just the lower level projectile clashing with nothing using the white frame inner outline and text description "A hit connected on this frame." A good example of this is Sol DI Gunflame vs Stun Edge. The game doesn't even make higher level projectiles aware that a clash happened so we now work around that. Similarly, added "A hit connected on this frame." framebar indicator to projectiles being reflected and the one reflecting them.
55) Added purple health display to Raven's Character Specific panel.
56) Chargeable moves will now display the amount of charge in the Combo Recipe panel.
57) Added alternative names for Faust Toss, Answer 6K, Jam Card Charge, Dizzy 6H, "For roasting chestnuts...", Haehyun Four Tigers Sword, Four Tigers Sword (Reverse), Falcon Dive, Falcon Dive (Reverse) for when they're held, and for Raven's Grausam Impuls, Wachen Zweig and Scharf Kugel (the projectile) for when they're buffed.
58) Elphelt Shotgun Reload and possibly other characters' moves now shown separately in Combo Recipe in order to make it possible to display delays in some cancels.
59) Leo Brynhildr Stance in Combo Recipe now can display (micro)walks and shows (Idle Xf) instead of (Delay Xf), and changes animation name to Brynhildr Walk Forward/Back in framebar's frame tooltips when walking in stance. Leo's 5H, 6H, Zwei and Leidenschaft Dirigent will now alter their name in the Combo Recipe, in the Move name, and in framebar tooltip's animation name if held or, for Zwei, if crossed up the opponent to enter Brynhildr stance, and the name will add "into Brynhildr" or "into Backturn" (slang version).
60) Johnny's Mist Finer Stance can now display (micro)walks and idle time between cancels in the Combo Recipe panel.
61) Elphelt's Berry Pine will now show a powerup icon in the framebar when either the grenade timer reaches 1 second or the Berry Pine is spawned with the timer already being under 1 second.
62) Fixed the displayed frame counts on the framebar changing incorrectly in certain situations when scrolling the framebar horizontally.
63) Added an option to bypass room connection restrictions.
64) Added an option to highlight the player character red, green, blue or a combination of these colours when they become idle or when a particular cancel becomes available. You can select desired cancels from a menu. See Settings - General Settings - "Highlight Red/Green/Blue When Becoming Idle" and "Highlight When Cancels Into Moves Available" button.
65) Added an option to make all of the mod's windows be transparent or semi-transparent and have outlined text. This does not apply to the Combo Recipe panel (except window transparency - that will affect Combo Recipe), as it has its own setting for this (if Combo Recipe is individually set to be transparent, it will be, despite what the global setting says), and Combo Damage & Burst Gain panel, as it is always transparent and outlined anyway.
66) Added a pin button to all of the mod's windows, which does the following: 1) it locks those windows on top of all others; 2) if multiple windows are pinned, their order is fixed based on in which order you pinned them; 3) pressing the UI show/hide toggle (ESC by default) will instead, if non-pinned windows are also present, traverse through three states: State 1: all windows are visible; State 2: only pinned windows are visible; State 3: no windows are visible; 4) Pinned windows get saved for the next restart, and can be restored on startup if you checked the 'Settings - General Settings - Open Pinned Windows On Startup' setting (ON by default).
67) Now closing the main UI window does not close the whole UI. However, when you press the hotkey for showing/hiding UI (ESC by default), the main UI window will reappear automatically. To get rid of it you could pin every window but the main one and use ESC to toggle between "show all" - "show only pinned" - "show none" modes, stopping only on "show only pinned" and "show none", therefore not letting the main window be displayed.
68) The Cancels panel now shows YRC windows. You can disable this in Settings - General Settings - Show YRC Windows In Cancels Panel.
69) In Combo Recipe, when showing microwalks or microdashes is disabled but showing idle time is enabled, microwalks and/or microdashes will be converted to idle time and all idle time there will be fused together and displayed as one entry of #) (Idle Xf).
70) Added options in General Settings to prevent RISC from resetting in Training Mode when that player is not entirely idle, like for example when performing a Burst, and to prevent Burst Gauge and Tension Gauge from resetting (this is all Training Mode) when one of the players is not entirely idle (here the example would be Faint/Dizziness animation), and to prevent Training Mode's Counter Hit - Forced/Random/Forced Mortal Counter setting from taking effect on opponents that are either in Burst or Faint/Dizziness animation.
71) Added fields to enter starting burst gauge values for P1 and P2 in General Settings.
72) Added an option to make Combo Recipe clear itself on Position Reset. This option is ON by default. It can be found in Combo Recipe's cogwheel.
73) Added new framebar frame types for "Normal landing recovery" and "Backdash recovery". These frames will be black with blue hatching at the bottom.
74) Split "Starting Tension Pulse" setting into two separate settings: one for P1, one for P2.
- 2025 October 11: Version 7.1: Fixed everything, except damage, not being reset in Combo Damage & Combo Stun on combo restart or even position reset (damage was already resetting properly).
- 2025 October 14: Version 7.2: Fixed 'Display Durations In Input History' mode when the icons would be offset way too much from the text on higher screen resolutions. Added an option to scale the 'Startup, Active, Recovery, Total, Advantage' text next to the framebar, and it will now by default scale automatically to 2 times the size when on screen width larger than 1920. Made the text inside the frames that shows the number of same consecutive frames scale larger on higher screen resolutions.
- 2025 October 19: Version 7.3: Added an option to display a "PUNISH" message when punishing a move. There are two settings for this: Settings - General Settings - "Show 'Punish' Message When Punishing Presumed Recovery' and "Show 'Punish' Message When Punishing After A Block/Hit/Armor".
- 2025 October 19: Version 7.4: Exclude hitting someone during their dash (yes, even Johnny's dash) or backdash animation from the "PUNISH" message. Exclude Blitz Shield Reject from the "PUNISH" message. After blocking/getting hit/armoring, if the hit you blocked/got hit by/armored was by a projectile, and after creating that projectile opponent has changed animation (i.e. recovered), then, if you "punish" afterwards, it won't show the "PUNISH" message.
- 2025 October 22: Version 7.5: Fixed `Position Reset Mod`, `Player 1/2 Is Boss`, `Highlight Red/Green/Blue When Becoming Idle`, `Don't Reset Burst And Tension Gauges When In Faint`, `Don't Reset RISC When In Burst Or Faint` checkboxes and `Highlight When Cancels Into Moves Available` list not having any effect if turned on after the mod is already initialized with them being off, and only enabling those features after the mod is reloaded with them being on.
- 2025 October 22: Version 7.6: Fix the Pin icon's graphics in mod's windows being gibberish.
- 2025 October 29: Version 7.7: Added an "FPS" field to regulate the game's FPS.
- 2025 November 6: Version 7.8: Added Hitbox Editor, accessible through the "Hitbox Editor" button in the "Hitboxes" section of the main UI.
- 2025 November 6: Version 7.9: Added hotkey-able commands to Hitbox Editor to rearrange boxes up and down in the Z-order.
- 2025 November 6: Version 7.10: Redo the hotkey-able commands in Hitbox Editor so they rearrange boxes up and down the Z-order properly.
- 2025 November 11: Version 7.11: Updated some tooltips in Hitbox Editor. Fixed an issue when the Hitbox Editor window is pinned and the drop-down lists display behind it. Fixed an issue when the buttons to save and load collision data for P2 and Common were unclickable.
- 2025 November 12: Version 7.12: Framebar frame cancels and "Cancels" panel now can display "Clash cancels" gatling/cancel, which is available during the 16f hitstop of a clash and for 10f afterwards. It displays similar to the "Special cancel" gatling/cancel. For danger time clash it is available during the last 16f of the 99f of clash hitstop and for 10f afterwards.
- 2025 November 13: Version 7.13: Prevent loss of imgui settings and sigscan cache caused by navigating folders when saving .collision or .json hitbox data from the Hitbox Editor. Fix exported .collision file causing Xrd to crash when loaded through Pangaea's mod, which was caused by an error in this mod's Hitbox Editor when adding too many new sprites.
- 2025 November 14: Version 7.14: Added a checkbox to enable BBScript (.bbscript files) and Collision (.collision files) mods. They get loaded from the 'Mods' folder in the game's installation directory, if one is present.
- 2025 November 15: Version 7.15: Fix a crash when using the key Up to scroll the 'Anim sequence' list in the Hitbox Editor and running into the very top "None" element.
- 2025 December 2: Version 7.16: Framebars and framedata display correct information now when catching up in observer mode and when participating directly as one of the players in an online match. Added a hotkey to speed up replay playback. Fixed a problem with clearing input history when it's with durations (after clearing it would display the first few inputs incorrectly, but work fine afterwards).
- 2025 December 16: Version 7.17: Fixed a framebar tooltip on Elphelt's projectile framebar explaining a powerup icon as a berry pine having reached its charge due to timer, which was also displaying on proximity-powered maximum charge shotgun shots. Now Elphelt charged shotgun shots that have the powerup due to proximity have their own powerup explanation in the frame tooltip. Fixed projectile and combined projectile framebars that have scrolled off the view not always reappearing when scrolling back into the past. Fixed combined projectile framebars displaying wrong frame counts when scrolling back into the past. Added Blitz Shield rejection frame to the framebar.
- 2025 December 23: Version 7.18: Fixed a crash that was happening when the mod is present during an online non-observer match, caused by changes since version 7.17. It was caused by writing past the bounds of a projectile framebar's 'frames' heap buffer when reverting framebars to a previous state in correspondence with the game's rollback.
- 2026 February 8: Version 7.19: Added "Quick Character Select" tab to the main mod UI window.
- 2026 February 9: Version 7.20: Fixed "Quick Character Select" popup not appearing upon hotkey press if all mod's windows have been closed.
- 2026 February 10: Version 7.21: Added a new mode for "Quick Character Select" that appears only when the hotkey/hotbutton is held and disappears when not held, and the selection is changed using the gamepad controls, and it captures gamepad input to hide it from the game, and stopping holding the hotkey/hotbutton confirms the character selection. This new mode is the default setting. It can be changed in Main Mod UI - Quick Character Select - 'Use Controller-Friendly Quick Char Select'.
- 2026 February 12: Version 7.22: Fixed camera moving in player lobby when the mod's controller-friendly 'Quick Character Select' menu is open.
- 2026 February 14: Version 7.23: Increased the default deadzone for mod's stick controls, which affects the default controls for the Controller-Friendly Quick Character Select menu. You can configure the deadzone in Settings - Keyboard Settings - Deadzone For Mod's Stick Controls (Percentage). Improved replay and observer fast-forward so that it can also speed up intros, roundstarts, roundends, outros and supers (although speeding these up comes at a much higher processing cost, possibly unbearable for slower machines). The new fast-forward gets automatically applied to the online observer mode when catching up without having to press any hotkey. You can configure the fast-forward speeds for the observer mode and the replay mode separately in General Settings.
- 2026 February 19: Version 7.24:
1) Fixed Jump Install not being shown in Combo Recipe when doing Chipp stuff > 2D > Resshou, 8P > 2H > 22H > stuff. The problem was caused by the move having a 3f startup. This should fix all moves that have a startup that fast.
2) Fixed scrollbar not working in the non Controller-Friendly Quick Character Select when trying to scroll with the mouse.
3) Added a setting to turn off modded fast-forward for observer and replay modes, the one which fast-forwards supers and the like by increasing FPS. By default the modded fast-forward will be on.
4) Added color and side-swap settings for the 'Punish' message.
5) Added a setting to turn off most of the mod's functions during non-observer multiplayer matches (the new setting will be ON by default).
6) Fixed an error when framebar would read out of bounds of a framebar in rollback-affected matches, potentially leading to a crash.
7) Fixed incorrect information in projectile framebars in rollback-affected matches, when projectile framebars would show randomly scattered single non-idle frames amidst huge spans of idle frames that are already far in the past yet still in view.
8) Added Quick Battle Chat, two flavors: one works by simply letting you configure a hotkey to open the chat prompt, the other works by letting you just type directly on the keyboard and sending what you typed after a while without pressing Enter. You can also optionally disable keyboard controls for battles.
9) Fixed Position Reset being limited by camera bounds when the stage resets not due to a button press, but due to the training dummy dying.
- 2026 February 27: Version 7.25:
1) Made Quick Char Select not open via hotkey press if that hotkey got pressed when typing text into an IME form.
2) Fixed a very likely crash when automatically injecting the mod into Xrd as soon as it starts by editing the BootGGXrd.bat and adding the following line into it: `start /MIN another.bat`. The other .bat contains: `start /MIN ggxrd_hitbox_injector -force`. Xrd launches directly into fullscreen mode. This would cause Xrd to freeze. The error was caused by the mod's DLL reading the FD3D9DynamicRHI pointer at game's 01ac818c, but it having a null Direct3DDevice at offset 0x24. The mod would then return FALSE from DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, but infinitely hang inside DLL_PROCESS_DETACH due to null endScene.logicThreadId and the UE3 logic tick not advancing for unknown reason, presumably because this happens during the rendering thread creation and those require a DLL lock.
- 2026 February 28: Version 7.26: Fixed a crash in Controller-Friendly Quick Character Select when using a DirectInput8-compatible controller device.
- 2026 March 23: Version 7.27: Made the hotkey that is configured to open Quick Character Select only not work during an active in-game text input UI element if that hotkey is also capable of producing a typed character in the text (For example, if the hotkey is "-", if I'm currently typing a chat message, do not open quick character select upon that press). Fixed replay and observer mode fast-forward not working since the very moment that feature was introduced, in version 7.16. Added display of received speed Y from air blocking in 'Speed/Hitstun Proration' panel in the 'Received Speed Y' field. Described in the tooltip how the speed Y from air blocking gets calculated. Fixed crashes in Hitbox Editor when selecting some Animation Sequences. Updated license to NON-AI-MIT license. Fixed a freeze when injecting the mod through the injector while OBS is working and the game is launching into fullscreen, however this now means that if OBS starts game capture in the middle of drawing a frame, it may capture one frame of game + overlay, despite the 'Dodge OBS Recording' setting being true.
- 2026 April 6: Version 7.28: Added a display of distances to each Rose from Millia's center to Millia's 'Character Specific' panel. Roses now display startup frames on the projectile framebars.
- 2026 April 10: Version 7.29: Fixed a rare freeze when injecting the mod while the game is booting (into fullscreen or windowed), caused by the mod suspending all threads but the injected thread, then trying to allocate some heap memory only to realize that the heap memory lock is already locked... by one of the suspended threads. This would cause a deadlock, or infinite freeze. This was solved by atomically hooking one of the functions that runs on the main thread, then proceeding to hook all the rest of the needed functions from there (they all are supposed to run on the main thread). There's no need to suspend any threads this way. Unfortunately, this also means that should any error arise while injecting the mod, it will no longer be reported by the injector application. In other words, in case of any error, the mod will now silently fail to inject while reporting success.
- 2026 April 14: Version 7.30: Fixed an error introduced in 7.27 where the framebar and UI of the mod would not be possible to display if the `dodgeObsRecording` is set to `true` in the `GUILTY GEAR Xrd -REVELATOR-\Binaries\Win32\ggxrd_hitbox_overlay.ini` file, if OBS is not currently working and hooked into the game. The framebar and UI will, however, work, if OBS is hooked into the game, or the `dodgeObsRecording` setting is `false`. The `dodgeObsRecording` setting has been shipped with the default value of `false` since version 6.28, but existing users who created their INI file before that version would still have the old (default) value of `true` (if they haven't changed it to `false`).
- 2026 May 2: Version 7.31:
1) Added throw invulnerability display to Burst's pre-landing frame. This change may affect other animations that utilize the damageToAir bbscript instruction, in that previously we were, in addition to the flag that the instruction sets, checking `not (Y != 0 or speedY != 0)`, but now we only check `Y == 0` (without the enclosing 'not'). The reasoning in the old condition was that, on the pre-landing frame you would have Y == 0 and speedY still < 0 (Y axis is pointed up), on the landing frame you'd have Y == 0 and speedY == 0, so to fully exclude airborne I'd go "Y == 0 and speedY == 0". But the pre-landing frame is considered grounded for the purposes of ground throw vs air throw checks. And the game checks damageToAir flag only in conjunction with Y, ignoring speedY. So what I did was correct the check to be more in line with how the game checks it.
2) Added support for cross-compilation from Linux to Windows using MinGW GCC toolchain for all subprojects and dependencies.
- 2026 May 25: Version 7.32:
1) Combo Recipe panel can now show the amount of delay that a special was cancelled into from some previous move.
2) Fixed the "A new (potential) hit starts on this frame" tooltip (with corresponding new-hit-start graphic) being displayed on EVERY projectile frame on the framebar after and including the frame of the second hit. Now new hit graphics and tooltips will only be shown on frames where a new hit starts, not including the very first hit.
