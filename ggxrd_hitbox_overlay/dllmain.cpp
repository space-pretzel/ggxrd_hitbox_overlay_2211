		// we should not hook multiple functions here at once, as the DLL may be loaded from an injected thread
		// (I will explain why hooking multiple functions from a rogue thread is a bad idea shortly).
		// Even if we try to use the Detours library on even one function, we would have to suspend the main
		// thread (the one we hook) first, because Detours is very tidy and clean and relocates EIP between the trampoline and
		// the original code. This is good and we want that. Problem with suspending threads at all is that one of the
		// suspended threads may happen to be holding some heap memory lock, which, if we try to allocate some heap
		// memory of our own, may cause a deadlock, and this has already actually happened to me and I've confirmed
		// via debugging that this was the case.
		// The lock is internal to Win API and we can't easily check if it's already locked or not.
		// The way Detours is written, it does allocate memory in pretty much all of its functions that we interact with.
		// Our own code that interacts with detours also allocated dynamic memory.
		// Even if we get rid of all memory allocations during detour transactions, and make each DetourAttach be in a separate transaction,
		// that's just so many transactions, because we hook so, so many functions. Each transaction messes with
		// page protections for the detour regions (pages of allocated memory for trampolines).
		// And we'd have to suspend the main thread separately in each transaction as well, and each detour attach
		// operation would call GetThreadContext on that thread. This may be slow, therefore it's better to do just one
		// big transaction, and preferably without suspending any threads at all.
		// The way we achieve that is by patching an instruction that is known to be 5 bytes into another instruction
		// that is also 5 bytes. This does not require a suspension, because no EIP would have to be moved.
		// The new instruction is a call to our function, which will happen on the main thread, which is the one we hook,
		// which means if we proceed to hook all the rest of the functions from there, no suspension will be needed at all.
		// Which means we won't run into the heap memory deadlock.
		// Another interesting problem that may happen if you try to hook many functions from a separate thread using
		// a separate Detours transaction for each hook, is that the hooks may start running before they're all done,
		// which means that now in the hook code you must consider such possibility that other hooks may not be in place yet.
		// And when they're all in place, that may happen at any point during execution of the game, so what you really need
		// to wait for then is the end of the Unreal Engine tick. And that hints at the idea that maybe you should just install
		// all hooks in the Unreal Engine tick.
